# TronLink
Chrome Extension for Website to Blockchain Communication on the Tron Network

Currently, this build is directed towards developers.

Because the nodes on the current network have not migrated to the new TVM build, TronLink will initially be running on TronWatchâ€™s private network.
It will later be changed to use the official Tron test network until the main network nodes support the TVM.
